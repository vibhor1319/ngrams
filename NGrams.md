This is a ngrams package in C++, which can be used for character or word ngram analysis. It uses Ternary Search Tree instead of hashing table for faster ngram frequency counting. Words are converted to unique IDs and encoded to more compact base 256 integers.

It is a simplified implementation of Dr. Vlado Keselj's Text-Ngrams 1.6, which is a very flexible Ngram package in perl. See more information at http://users.cs.dal.ca/~vlado/srcperl/Ngrams/Ngrams.html

How to use it:

1. download and save the source code.

2. $ make

3. $ ngrams --type=word --n=3 --in= sample.txt

> or

> $ ngrams --type=character -n=3 --in= sample.txt

That's it.
